# MX Integration Guide for SmartPlannerAI

## Overview

SmartPlannerAI has been successfully migrated from Plaid to MX (Money Experience) for financial data aggregation. MX provides a free alternative to Plaid with robust features for personal finance management applications.

## Why MX?

- **Free Tier Available**: Unlike Plaid's paid-only model, MX offers free access for developers
- **PFM Focus**: Specifically designed for personal finance management applications
- **Data Quality**: Excellent data cleansing, categorization, and aggregation
- **Security**: Bank-level security with secure account linking
- **Comprehensive APIs**: Full feature set for account linking, transaction sync, and financial insights

## Features Implemented

### 1. Account Linking
- Secure bank account connection via MX Connect widget
- Support for 16,000+ financial institutions
- Real-time account verification
- OAuth-based authentication flow

### 2. Transaction Sync
- Automatic transaction categorization
- Real-time transaction updates
- Duplicate detection and handling
- Historical transaction import

### 3. Account Management
- Multiple account types (checking, savings, credit cards, loans, investments)
- Real-time balance updates
- Account metadata and institution information

### 4. Security & Compliance
- Encrypted data transmission
- Secure token management
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Audit logging for all financial operations

## Architecture

### Backend Components

#### MX Service (`server/services/mxService.ts`)
- **User Management**: Creates and manages MX users
- **Widget Integration**: Generates secure widget URLs for account linking
- **Account Sync**: Syncs account data and balances from MX
- **Transaction Sync**: Imports and categorizes transactions
- **Mock Data**: Fallback demo data when MX credentials are not configured

#### API Routes (`server/routes.ts`)
- `POST /api/mx/widget-url` - Generate MX Connect widget URL
- `POST /api/mx/connect-callback` - Handle successful account connection
- `POST /api/mx/sync` - Trigger account and transaction sync

#### Security Middleware
- Financial integration rate limiting (10 operations/hour)
- Authentication required for all MX endpoints
- Audit logging for compliance

### Frontend Components

#### MXConnect Component (`client/src/components/mx-connect.tsx`)
- React component for account linking
- Popup-based widget integration
- Error handling and user feedback
- Demo mode support
- Success/failure callbacks

#### Integration Points
- **Onboarding Flow**: Account linking during user setup
- **Dashboard**: Quick account connection
- **Analytics**: Connect accounts for insights

## Setup Instructions

### 1. MX API Credentials

1. Sign up for MX Developer Account at [developer.mx.com](https://developer.mx.com)
2. Create a new application
3. Obtain your credentials:
   - Client ID
   - API Key
   - Environment (sandbox/production)

### 2. Environment Configuration

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
# MX Configuration
MX_CLIENT_ID=your_mx_client_id_here
MX_API_KEY=your_mx_api_key_here
MX_ENV=sandbox  # sandbox or production
MX_WEBHOOK_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/mx/webhook
```

### 3. Database Schema

The MX integration reuses existing Plaid database fields for seamless migration:
- `plaidAccountId` → stores MX account GUID
- `plaidAccessToken` → stores encrypted MX member GUID
- `plaidItemId` → stores MX member GUID
- `plaidTransactionId` → stores MX transaction GUID

No database schema changes required!

### 4. Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your MX credentials

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Usage Examples

### Frontend - Account Linking

```tsx
import { MXConnect } from '@/components/mx-connect';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <MXConnect 
      onSuccess={() => {
        console.log('Account connected successfully!');
        // Refresh dashboard data
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

### Backend - Manual Sync

```typescript
import { mxService } from './services/mxService';

// Sync user accounts and transactions
await mxService.refreshAccountBalances(userId);
```

## Demo Mode

When MX credentials are not configured, the app automatically falls back to demo mode with mock data:

- Sample bank accounts (checking, savings, credit card)
- Realistic transaction history
- Categorized spending data
- Financial health metrics

This allows development and testing without requiring real MX credentials.

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid Credentials**
   - Check MX_CLIENT_ID and MX_API_KEY
   - Verify environment setting (sandbox vs production)

2. **Widget Not Loading**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify CORS settings for widget domain
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Sync Failures**
   - Check MX API status
   - Verify rate limits not exceeded
   - Check audit logs for error details

### Debugging

Enable debug logging by setting:
```bash
DEBUG=mx:*
```

Check server logs for MX API requests and responses.

## Security Considerations

1. **Credential Management**
   - Never commit real MX credentials to version control
   - Use environment variables for all sensitive data
   - Rotate API keys regularly

2. **Data Encryption**
   - All MX tokens are encrypted before database storage
   - Use strong encryption keys in production
   - Secure transmission with HTTPS only

3. **Access Control**
   - All MX endpoints require authentication
   - Rate limiting prevents abuse
   - Audit logging tracks all operations

## Production Deployment

### Environment Setup

1. Set `MX_ENV=production`
2. Use production MX credentials
3. Configure secure webhook URL
4. Enable HTTPS for all endpoints
5. Set strong encryption keys

### Monitoring

- Monitor MX API usage and rate limits
- Set up alerts for sync failures
- Track user connection success rates
- Monitor account and transaction sync performance
